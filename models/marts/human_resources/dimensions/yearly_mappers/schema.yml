    description: >
      This table maps and formats each employment status to it's friendly name.
      The dimension is build up on the seed employment_status.
      The dimension is yearly padded, meaning that an additional column named year is infered from the valid_from and valid_unitl seed columns and added to the dimension.
      The dimension gives, for a given year, the valid employment status for this year.
      Using this dimension hence requiers you to join on the school year as well as the etat_empl columns.
      In case you only need the most up-to-date (ie, used during this school year) mapping, you can add the following join clause / filter to your query:
      `is_current = 1`

      This dimension can be overriden by the client to add consistent employment status names' formatting.
